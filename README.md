## Installation
Configure and build ZCCL:
```bash
# Decompress the downloaded files
# Change to ZCCL directory and set up the installation directory:
cd ZCCL
mkdir install

# Run the configuration script:
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/install --enable-openmp CC=mpicc

# Compile ZCCL using multiple threads:
make -j

# Install the compiled ZCCL:
make install

# Change to the jobs directory to proceed with running the ZCCL:
cd jobs
```
### Installation Note
1. if seeing `configure.ac:22: error possibly undefinded macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL` when running command `./autogen.sh`, simply replace 'AC_PROG_LIBTOOL' with 'LT_INIT' at line 22 on 'configure.ac'.
2. Some prerequisite packages you may needed in Linux system: 'libtool', 'automake', 'autoconf', 'mpich'. You can install them using the following command:
    - 'sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install libtool automake autoconf mpich'
3. Consider building MPICH from source for the best performance and reliability.
